# User Authentication and Authorization in Web Applications

<h3>Authentication and Authorization are core security parts of any website because not every user should access every page or resource.</h3>

**Authentication** → verifies who the user is.

**Authorization** → checks what the authenticated user is allowed to do.

<h3>Examples:</h3>

* Only admin should access admin dashboard.

* Only logged-in users should access profile page.

* Public pages are accessible to all.

<h3>For every protected route, the system first authenticates the user, then authorizes them based on their role.</h3>
